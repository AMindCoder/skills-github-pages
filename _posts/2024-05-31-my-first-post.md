# What are Embedding Models?
In the realm of machine learning and artificial intelligence, embedding models play a crucial role in transforming complex data, such as text, images, and audio, into a format readily understood by machines. Imagine trying to teach a computer about the concept of “love.” Simply providing it with a dictionary definition wouldn’t suffice. Instead, we need a way to represent the essence of “love” in a manner that captures its various nuances and relationships to other concepts. This is where embedding models come into play.

At their core, embedding models are algorithms designed to encapsulate information into dense representations within a multi-dimensional space. These representations, known as embeddings, are essentially vectors of numbers that encode the semantic meaning of the input data. To illustrate, consider the words “king,” “queen,” “man,” and “woman.” An embedding model trained on a vast corpus of text would learn to position these words in the vector space such that “king” and “queen” are closer together, reflecting their shared royalty attribute, while “man” and “woman” would be similarly grouped based on gender.
